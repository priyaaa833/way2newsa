        |        | Online newspapers, also known as digital newspapers or e-newspapers, are web-based versions of traditional print newspapers. They serve the same fundamental purpose as print newspapersâ€”to inform readers about current events, news stories, features, and opinions on various topics, but they do so in a digital format accessible via computers, smartphones, tablets, and other connected devices.
